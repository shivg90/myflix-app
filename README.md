# myFlix-API

## Objective
To build the server-side component of a movie web application called "myFlix".
The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. 
Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

The application implements a REST API with use of a self-made database hosted by mongoDB.\
Two client side components which use the API:
- https://github.com/shivg90/myFlix-client
